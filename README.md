# CFCR/Kubo Deployment with Compiled Releases

I want it to be fast and fun for people to get started with BOSH and Kubernetes. What I want is a two-step process:

* `bucc up` to deploy a BOSH environment to your favourite cloud (or locally via VirtualBox)
* `bosh deploy cfcr.yml` to deploy CFCR/Kubernetes using pre-compiled BOSH releases
